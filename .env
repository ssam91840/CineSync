# Directory Structure Configuration
# ========================================

# When true, the processing will use a custom folder structure as defined in the script
# If false, the script will use the resolution-based folder structure for organizing files
OVERRIDE_STRUCTURE=false

# Enable or disable maintaining the source directory structure
# When true, the script will retain the original source directory names in the destination paths
