# ========================================
# Directory Paths
# ========================================
# Source directory for input files
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/files"

# Destination directory for output files
DESTINATION_DIR="/path/to/destination"

# Use source structure for organizing files
# When true, the original folder structure from the source directory will be preserved
# When false, files will be organized into a predefined resolutions based folder structure (e.g., UltaHD, Remux)
USE_SOURCE_STRUCTURE=false

# Custom folder paths for media organization
# These settings only take effect when CINESYNC_LAYOUT=true
# Leave empty to use default paths (CineSync/Shows and CineSync/Movies)
# Examples:
#   CUSTOM_SHOW_FOLDER="TV Shows"         -> /destination/TV Shows/{show_name}
#   CUSTOM_MOVIE_FOLDER="Movies/HD"       -> /destination/Movies/HD/{movie_name}
# Resolution-based organization settings
# This can be configured independently for shows and movies
# Works with both default and custom folder structures
# Examples:
#   -> /destination/Custom_folder/UltraHD/{show_name}
#   -> /destination/Custom_folder/UltraHD/{movie_name}
CINESYNC_LAYOUT=false
ANIME_SEPARATION=true

# ========================================
# Logging Configuration
# ========================================
# Set the log level for application logging
# Available options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

# ========================================
# Rclone Mount Configuration
# ========================================
# Enable or disable rclone mount verification
# When true, the system will verify if directories are properly mounted via rclone
# and wait for mount points to become available before processing
# This is useful when working with remote storage mounted via rclone
RCLONE_MOUNT=false

# Interval (in seconds) for checking rclone mount availability
# This determines how frequently the script will verify mount points when RCLONE_MOUNT is enabled
# Only relevant when RCLONE_MOUNT=true
# Lower values provide quicker mount detection but may increase system load
MOUNT_CHECK_INTERVAL=30

# ========================================
# TMDb/IMDB Configuration
# ========================================
# Your TMDb API key for accessing TMDb services
# Note: TMDb API is required for both TMDb and IMDb folder structures,
# as IMDb data is sourced via the TMDb API.
# Note: TMDb API is still required for fetching external IDs like IMDB & TVDB
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here

# Enable or disable anime-specific scanning
# When true, the system will apply specialized rules for identifying and processing anime files
ANIME_SCAN=false

# Enable or disable TMDb folder ID functionality
# When true, folder names will be based on TMDb IDs
TMDB_FOLDER_ID=false

# Enable or disable IMDb folder ID functionality
# When true, folder names will be based on IMDb IDs
IMDB_FOLDER_ID=false

# Enable or disable TVDb folder ID functionality
# When true, folder names for TV shows will be based on TVDb IDs
# This provides an alternative to IMDb and TMDb ID-based folder naming
TVDB_FOLDER_ID=false

# Enable or disable file renaming based on TMDb data
# When true, files will be renamed according to TMDb information
RENAME_ENABLED=false

# Optional tags to include in file renaming
# Specify which tags from predefined categories to include in the filename
# Categories include: VideoCodec, AudioCodec, AudioAtmos, DynamicRange, AudioChannels
# Resolutions, MovieVersions, StreamingServices, Languages, TMDB/IMDB (if needed)
# Leave empty to disable additional tag inclusion in filenames. Default will be Resolution.
RENAME_TAGS=Resolution

# ========================================
# Movie Collection Settings
# ========================================
# Enable or disable separating movie files based on collections
# When true, movies will be organized into folders according to their collections (e.g., Harry Potter series)
MOVIE_COLLECTION_ENABLED=false

# ========================================
# System based Configuration
# ========================================
# Create relative symlinks instead of absolute symlinks
# When true, symlinks will use relative paths
RELATIVE_SYMLINK=false

# Set the maximum number of parallel processes for creating symlinks
# Increase this number to speed up processing if you have a multi-core CPU
# Set to 1 for single-threaded processing to minimize system load
MAX_PROCESSES=1

# ========================================
# File Handling Configuration
# ========================================
# Enable or disable the creation and processing of extras folder files
# When true, files meant for the 'Extras' folder will be skipped and not processed
# This can be useful if you want to temporarily exclude extras files from being processed
# Maximum allowed file size for extras in MB. Files larger than this limit will not be considered as extras. (Deafult: 250MB)
SKIP_EXTRAS_FOLDER=true
EXTRAS_MAX_SIZE_MB=250

# Allowed file extensions for processing
# Only files with these extensions will be considered for processing.
# Example: .mp4, .mkv
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS=.mp4,.mkv,.srt

# Enable or disable skipping of specific file patterns
# When true, files matching patterns defined in utils/keywords.json 'skip_patterns'
# will be excluded from processing. This is useful for filtering out specific
# content types or file naming patterns that should not be processed.
SKIP_ADULT_PATTERNS=true

# ========================================
# Real-Time Monitoring Configuration
# ========================================
# Sleep time (in seconds) for real-time monitoring script
# This determines how frequently the script will check for changes in the watch directories
# (Cleanup) for deleting broken symbolic links in entire directory
# Adjust this value based on your needs and system performance
SLEEP_TIME=60
SYMLINK_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=600

# ========================================
# Plex Integration Configuration
# ========================================
# Enable or disable Plex library updates
# When true, Plex will be notified to scan for new content after files are processed
# This ensures your Plex library stays in sync with your media files
ENABLE_PLEX_UPDATE=false

# URL & Token for your Plex Media Server
# Example url: http://localhost:32400 or https://plex.example.com:32400
PLEX_URL=your-plex-url
PLEX_TOKEN=your-plex-token

# ========================================
# Database Configuration
# ========================================
# Throttle rate for database operations (requests per second)
# Controls the rate at which database operations are performed
# Higher values may increase performance but could also lead to higher resource usage
DB_THROTTLE_RATE=100

# Maximum number of retries for database operations in case of failure
# Defines how many times the script will attempt to retry a failed database operation
# Set to 0 to disable retries
DB_MAX_RETRIES=10

# Delay (in seconds) between retry attempts for database operations
# Specifies the wait time before retrying a failed database operation
DB_RETRY_DELAY=1.0

# Batch size for processing records from the database
# Controls the number of records processed in each batch
# Increasing this value can improve performance but may use more memory
DB_BATCH_SIZE=1000

# Maximum number of parallel workers for database operations
# Sets the number of parallel threads used for processing batches of database records
# Adjust this value based on your system's capabilities and workload
DB_MAX_WORKERS=4
