# Logging Configuration
# ========================================
# Set the log level for application logging
# Available options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

# ========================================
# Rclone Mount Configuration
# ========================================
# Enable or disable rclone mount verification
# When true, the system will verify if directories are properly mounted via rclone
# and wait for mount points to become available before processing
# This is useful when working with remote storage mounted via rclone
RCLONE_MOUNT=false

# Interval (in seconds) for checking rclone mount availability
# This determines how frequently the script will verify mount points when RCLONE_MOUNT is enabled
# Only relevant when RCLONE_MOUNT=true
# Lower values provide quicker mount detection but may increase system load

# ========================================
# TMDb/IMDB Configuration

# Note: TMDb API is required for both TMDb and IMDb folder structures,
# as IMDb data is sourced via the TMDb API.

# Enable or disable TMDb folder ID functionality
# When true, folder names will be based on TMDb IDs

# Enable or disable IMDb folder ID functionality
# When true, folder names will be based on IMDb IDs
# Note: TMDb API is still required for IMDb-based structures.

# When true, files will be renamed according to TMDb information

# Movie Collection Settings
# ========================================
# Enable or disable separating movie files based on collections
# When true, movies will be organized into folders according to their collections (e.g., Harry Potter series)

# ========================================
# System based Configuration
# ========================================

# ========================================
# File Handling Configuration
# ========================================
# Enable or disable the creation and processing of extras folder files
# When true, files meant for the 'Extras' folder will be skipped and not processed
# This can be useful if you want to temporarily exclude extras files from being processed
# Maximum allowed file size for extras in MB. Files larger than this limit will not be considered as extras. (Deafult: 100MB)
SKIP_EXTRAS_FOLDER=true
EXTRAS_MAX_SIZE_MB=100

# Enable or disable skipping of specific file patterns
# When true, files matching patterns defined in utils/keywords.json 'skip_patterns'
# will be excluded from processing. This is useful for filtering out specific
# content types or file naming patterns that should not be processed.

# ========================================
# Real-Time Monitoring Configuration
# ========================================

# This determines how frequently the script will check for changes in the watch directories
# Adjust this value based on your needs and system performance

# ========================================
# Database Configuration
# ========================================
# Throttle rate for database operations (requests per second)
# Controls the rate at which database operations are performed
# Higher values may increase performance but could also lead to higher resource usage

# Maximum number of retries for database operations in case of failure
# Defines how many times the script will attempt to retry a failed database operation
# Set to 0 to disable retries
DB_MAX_RETRIES=10

# Delay (in seconds) between retry attempts for database operations
# Specifies the wait time before retrying a failed database operation

# Batch size for processing records from the database
# Controls the number of records processed in each batch
# Increasing this value can improve performance but may use more memory

# Sets the number of parallel threads used for processing batches of database records
# Adjust this value based on your system's capabilities and workload
